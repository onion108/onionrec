# OnionRec

A simple script using `wf-recorder` and `pactl` to record screen with sounds and then save to a given location or Videos dir by default.

To run it, you need to install `sbcl`, and two binaries mentions before.

Environment variable `ONIONREC_DIR` can be used to specify default directory.
